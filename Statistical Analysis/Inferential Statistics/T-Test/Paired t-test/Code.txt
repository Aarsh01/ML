PAIRED T-TEST
Letâ€™s perform a paired t-test to verify if the change is statistically significant.


# Sample Sizes
N = 25

# Degrees of freedom  
dof = N - 1

# Gaussian distributed data with mean = 10.5 and var = 1  
x = np.random.randn(N) + 10.5

# Gaussian distributed data with mean = 9.9 and var = 1  
y = np.random.randn(N) + 9.9

t_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_rel(x,y)
print("t-statistic = " + str(t_stat))  
print("p-value = " + str(p_val))

CODE EXPLAINATION
This code is written in Python and uses the NumPy and SciPy libraries.
The first line sets the sample size to 25.
The second line calculates the degrees of freedom, which is the sample size minus one.
The next two lines generate two sets of data, x and y, that are normally distributed with means of 10.5 and 9.9, respectively, and a variance of 1. The np.random.randn() function generates random numbers from a standard normal distribution, and the + operator shifts the mean to the desired value.
The stats.ttest_rel() function from the SciPy library performs a paired t-test on the two sets of data. The t-test is used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. The function returns the t-statistic and the p-value.
The last two lines print the t-statistic and p-value to the console.


OUTPUT:
t-statistic = 3.446152658909739
p-value = 0.0021043953630465787

INTERPRETATION OF THE TEST RESULTS
The low p-value indicates that the null hypothesis is rejected, i.e., there is no change in the diameter of the ball bearings after introducing the new casting machine.
