	Population Mean -  summition of xi/N , i belong to [1,N]

	n - Sample Data
	Sample Mean - summition of xi/n  , i belong to [1,n]


## MEDIAN - The median is the middle number in a sorted list of numbers and can be more descriptive of that data set than the average. 
		  - The median is sometimes used rather than the mean when there are outliers in the sequence that might skew the average of the values.
		
	Even - take two middle/2
	Odd - take middle/2

## MODE - The most common number that appears in your set of data.
