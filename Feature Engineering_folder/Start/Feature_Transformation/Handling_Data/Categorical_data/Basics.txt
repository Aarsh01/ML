1. Label Encoding - Used to encode the TARGET col, when nature is categorical 
2. Ordinal Encoding - Used to encode the INPUT col, when DATA IS ORDINAL IN NATURE



Nominal Data - When we can't order the category in seq. like (Male, Female)/ colors(Yellow, Red, Green)


3. OHE(One-Hot-Encoding) - Used when data is NOMINAL in nature

OHE - convert the categories into diff n cols 

Dummy Variable - delete any one col (n-1 se proceed kargye) because of the MULTICOLLINERITY concept

OHE with frequent variables - Use the col OTHER for those who are less in number and do the same OHE on remaining categories who are in large number as compared to the OTHER category.
