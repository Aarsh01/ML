# MSE | MAE | RMSE | R2 SCORE | ADJUSTED R2 SCORE

1. MSE
	a. In statistics, the mean squared error (MSE) is a risk function that measures the square of errors. 
	b. When performing regression, use MSE if you believe your target is normally distributed and you want large errors to be penalized more than small ones.
	c. Lesser the MSE => Smaller is the error => Better the estimator.

	d. The Mean Squared Error is calculated as:

		MSE = (1/n) * Σ(actual – forecast)2

		where:
			Σ – a symbol that means “sum”
			n – sample size
			actual – the actual data value
			forecast – the predicted data value


2. MAE
	a. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is a measure of the average size of the mistakes in a collection of predictions, without taking their direction into account. 
	b. It is measured as the average absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual values and is used to assess the effectiveness of a regression model.

	c. The MAE loss function formula:

		MAE = (1/n) Σ(i=1 to n) |y_i – ŷ_i|
	
		where:

			n is the number of observations in the dataset.
			y_i is the true value.
			ŷ_i is the predicted value.


3. RMSE
	a. It measures the average difference between values predicted by a model and the actual values. 
	b. It provides an estimation of how well the model is able to predict the target value (accuracy).
	c. The lower the value of the Root Mean Squared Error, the better the model is. 
	d. A perfect model (a hypothetic model that would always predict the exact expected value) would have a Root Mean Squared Error value of 0.
	e. The Root Mean Squared Error can be interpreted as the standard deviation of the error (it's the square root of the error variance).

4. R2 SCORE
	a. How much regression line mean line se kitna better hai. 
	b. Also knowns as "Coefficient of determination" also "Goodness of Fit".
	
	c. The R2 SCORE function formula:
	
		R2 = 1 - (SSr/SSm)
		
		where:
			SSr = Summ of Squared Error in regression line
			SSm = Summ of Squared Error in Mean Line
			
	d. R2 score moves to 1 then model performance moves towards perfection and moves to 0 then model performance start acting bad
	e. R-Squared (R² or the coefficient of determination) is a statistical measure in a regression model that determines the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable.
	
5. ADJUSTED R2 SCORE
	a. Adjusted R2 is a corrected goodness-of-fit (model accuracy) measure for linear models. 
	b. It identifies the percentage of variance in the target field that is explained by the input or inputs.
	c. R2 tends to optimistically estimate the fit of the linear regression. 
	d. It always increases as the number of effects are included in the model. 
	e. Adjusted R2 attempts to correct for this overestimation. 
	f. Adjusted R2 might decrease if a specific effect does not improve the model.
	
	g. The ADJUSTED R2 SCORE function formula:
		
		1-[((1-R2)(n-1))/(n-1-k)]
		
		where:
			
			n - No. of rows
			k - Independant variables, {k=1,2,3....}
